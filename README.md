# Full Stack Web Application with React and Spring Boot

This project is a Full Stack web application developed using **React** for the front-end and **Spring Boot** for the back-end. The application demonstrates essential skills for building a responsive and secure web application, including user authentication, role-based access control, and payment processing.

## Features

- **React Frontend**:
  - Responsive and modern UI built with React.
  - User authentication using JWT, OAuth2, and OpenID Connect.
  - Role-based access control (e.g., Admin vs. User features).
  
- **Spring Boot Backend**:
  - RESTful API development.
  - MySQL database integration for persistent data storage.
  - Security features: JWT-based authentication, OAuth2, OIDC.
  
- **Additional Features**:
  - Payment processing using Stripe API (for eCommerce functionality).
  - HTTPS/SSL/TLS setup for secure communication.
  
## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- React
- React Router
- Axios (for HTTP requests)
- CSS for styling

### Backend
- Java Spring Boot
- Spring Security
- MySQL
- Hibernate (JPA)
- Stripe API (for payments)

### Tools & Build Setup
- IntelliJ IDEA (for backend development)
- Visual Studio Code (for frontend development)
- Maven (for backend dependency management)
- npm (for frontend dependency management)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 11 or higher
- Node.js 14 or higher
- MySQL (or any preferred relational database)
- Maven
- npm

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name

   
Backend Setup:

Navigate to the backend directory.
Configure your MySQL database settings in application.properties:
properties

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_db_name
spring.datasource.username=your_db_username
spring.datasource.password=your_db_password
Run the backend application using Maven:
bash

mvn spring-boot:run
Frontend Setup:

Navigate to the frontend directory.
Install dependencies:
bash

npm install
Run the React development server:
bash

npm start
Stripe Setup:

Set up your Stripe API keys in the .env file (frontend):
env

REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_stripe_public_key
REACT_APP_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key

Usage
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 for the React app.
The Spring Boot backend will run on http://localhost:8080 by default.

Authentication
Use the login feature to authenticate users.
Admin users will have access to additional admin-related pages and features.

Payment Processing
Use the Stripe-integrated payment page to simulate credit card transactions.

Security
User roles and permissions are managed using JWT tokens, OAuth2, and OIDC.
HTTPS/SSL/TLS is set up for secure data transmission.
